A generic code for multiple collinear ellastic/plates used in the paper "A spectral collocation method for acoustic scattering by multiple elastic plates". This code computes the scattered field (as defined in the paper) for elastic plate:

UT_multiplate_collinear.m  	routine to compute scattered field for incident wave of angle theta
field_plot.m			example use of UT_multiplate_collinear.m (currently set up to produce figure 4 from paper)
lgwt2.m				routine for Gaussian quadrature (uses Chebfun)

The data files contain spectral information regarding vibrational modes of finite plate with different clamped/free boundary conditions.
