# Unified_Transform
This repository contains some code for some papers on the unified transform (applied to elliptic PDEs).

Unbounded domains: code for paper "The unified transform for mixed boundary condition problems in unbounded domains"

Non-convex Domains and Corner Singularities: code for paper "On the Fokas method for the solution of elliptic problems in both convex and non-convex polygonal domains"

Elastic Plate Scattering: code for paper "A spectral collocation method for acoustic scattering by multiple elastic plates"
