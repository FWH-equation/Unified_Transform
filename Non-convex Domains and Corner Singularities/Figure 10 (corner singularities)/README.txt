Quick description of components of the code:

sing_func_laplace.m : plots the figure and calls the other routines.
Lap_sing.m: used to set up and solve the linear system.
sing_int.m: used to compute the integrals in terms of incomplete gamma functions.

NB: The code as set up makes use of Chebfun which can be found at http://www.chebfun.org/
